This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Full Stack E-Commerce Project, built with Next.js and React. Using React Contexts, Next.js features, Javascript new functions, CSS styling. Until now, you can navigate from homepage to Collections (hats, shoes + [id] - the dynamic page for each clothing item expanded detail: description + other), authentication form (users) + login/signup/logout functionality, checkout page/wishlist (without payment form yet). 

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
